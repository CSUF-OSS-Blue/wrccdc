Setup
To allow the current user to run docker and therefore start the containers, they must be added to the docker user group. To make the group change effective, either logout and login again or use su.

Add current user to docker group and apply group changes for the current shell environment
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && su $USER
For downloading the Greenbone Community Edition docker compose file, a destination directory should be created.

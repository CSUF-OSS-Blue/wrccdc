To get ansible working on Windows:
  Commands on Windows Machine:
    Powershell as admin Commands:
    $url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlbanAndrieu/ansible-windows/refs/heads/master/files/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
    $file = "$env:temp\Install-WMF3Hotfix.ps1"
    (New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file -Verbose

  CommandLine Commands: 
    ipconfig /all # you need the ip address of the windows machine for the hosts file in ansible
    #if making user in cmd:
    net user <name> /add
    #user used for ansible needs to be admin
    net localgroup Administrators <name> /add
    #set a password for the user 
    net user <name> <pass>
------------------------------------------------------------------
how the hosts file should look on the linux machine: 
[win]
192.168.239.143 #replace with ip address of windows device
[win:vars]
ansible_user=ansible #replace with user you created
ansible_password=ansible #replace with user pass you created
ansible_port=5986
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_scheme=https
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
ansible_winrm_kerberos_delegation=true

Check if everything works
    ansible win -m win_ping

test command for ansible playbook
    ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts systeminfo.yml
